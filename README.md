# pype

(in development)

*pype* is a python module for controlling organ valves through servo motors that have been attached to an arduino.

setting up *pype* for controlling the servo motor:
    1. installing pype and all dependencies on your computer
    2. connect the arduino to your computer
    3. upload the 'StandardFirmata' program (as it can be found in the standard example files or [here](https://github.com/firmata/arduino/blob/master/examples/StandardFirmata/StandardFirmata.ino))
    4. load python interpreter and use pype:

```python
from pype import pipes
from mu.mel import mel

# defining the pitch of your pipe
pitch = mel.SimplePitch(concert_pitch_freq=440, cents=-1200)  # a3

# defining the arduino pin of the servo motor
pin = 10

# defining the actual pipe object
my_pipe = pipes.ServoPipe(pitch, pin)

# open the valve, so that air could enter the pipe
my_pipe.on()

# close the valve, so that no air could enter the pipe anymore
my_pipe.off()

# open the valve slowly over 3 seconds
my_pipe.on(3)

# infinitely open and close the valve
my_pipe.tremolo(1)

# stop all processes
my_pipe.stop()
```
